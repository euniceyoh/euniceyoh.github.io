            Hi, I’m Eunice! I’m from the San Francisco Bay Area and a computer science student at San Jose State University. I'm also an exchange student at Sungkyunkwan University for the Spring 2023 semester (Feb - June). I will graduate with a bachelor's degree in May 2023. 
            I have been a software engineering intern at Amazon and Pendo, and I volunteered as a software developer for a nonprofit, Computers2Kids. I am looking to enter the workforce as a full-time software engineer after I graduate.
